# Todo Tracker - CMPT 211 Final Project

This app allows a user to enter a date and a time along with a label. The app will then store the data within a local JSON file as well as displaying the information on the site. Once stored, the due dates will be seperated into categories of years, months, weeks, and days. Using the date information, the todo is displayed with a countdown timer next to the event on the site.

## Requirements
* Node.js

## Usage

To run the app, navigate to todo directory in a terminal and run the commands:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Once the packages have been successfully installed and the application has started, **navigate to the url** [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred browser

### Adding Events
To add a todo entry, select a date and time by clicking on their respective icons. To complete the process, type a name for the todo in the input box and **press the enter key**.

### Removing Events
To remove a todo entry, click the delete button on the right hand side of the event row.
